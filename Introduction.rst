Introduction

If clicking on Start->All Programs produces a list too long to scan comfortably, then
you will appreciate the improvement that SMOz (Start Menu Organizer) can provide. SMOz
allows the program list to be organized automatically into a form much like the
newspaper classifieds where you find things by first looking in a particular classification.
You can also easily define the classifications, sub-classifications and all
the rules to define which program should go into which classification. This strategy can make it
much easier to find those programs which provide no desktop, toolbar or tray icon.
