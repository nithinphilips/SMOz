   A Start Menu after using SMOz.

SMOz (Start Menu Organizer) helps keep your Windows start menu organized.

SMOz provides an explorer-like view of the start menu where you can
simultaneously organize the start menu shortcuts that are spread
apart in multiple folders. You can quickly and easily drag and drop shortcuts
to categories of your choice. With unlimited undo-redo support, there is no risk.

SMOz also supports storing the categorization you have done to the start menu
as a template file, so you'll never have to repeat the work you've done.

With support for :wikipedia:`regular expression <Regular_expression>` rules in
the template, SMOz allows you to write complex templates. Advanced users can
thus quickly write powerful templates with little effort.
