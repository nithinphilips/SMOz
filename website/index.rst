   A Start Menu after using SMOz.

SMOz (Start Menu Organizer) helps you keep your Windows start menu organized.

SMOz provides an explorer-like view of the start menu where you can
simultaneously organize the start menu shortcuts that are spread
apart in multiple folders. You can quickly and easily drag and drop shortcuts
to categories of your choice. With unlimited undo-redo support, there is risk.

SMOz also supports storing the categorization you have done to the start menu
as a template file. Whether you are a power user or a system administrator,
you'll never have to repeat the work you've done.

Furthermore, SMOz templates also support `regular expression
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression>`_ rules that give you a truly powerful way.
