  assist you in the organization of Windows start menu. SMOz provides

  Undo/Redo). In addition, SMOz provides support for templates, which
  allow you to automate the manipulation of start menu.

== 2. System Requirements ==
    SMOz will run on any platform that supports .NET Framework v2.0

== 4. Template Files ==
    A template consists of Categories and Values (similar to ini 
  files) except that there are no keys, only values.
    The line that starts with '[' and ends with ']' is a 'category'.
  Lines that are below a category are 'values'. Categories are the
  folders where values are moved to.
    
    TBD.
